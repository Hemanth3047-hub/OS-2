It can be done by using cd command(ex: cd desktop)


Next we have to use following commands


To comiple :   g++ SrcAssgn5-ES19BTECH11003-Coarse-grained.cpp  -o p -lpthread                   //for method 1
               g++ SrcAssgn5-ES19BTECH11003-Fine-grained.cpp -o p -lpthread                     //for method 2
To run     :   ./p
