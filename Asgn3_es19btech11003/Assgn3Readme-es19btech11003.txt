To run the program firstly we have to change our directory to whichever the directory file is located in.
we can do this by using cd command(ex: cd Music)


Next we have to use following commands


To comiple :  g++ srcAssgn3-tas-es19btech11003.cpp -o -a -lpthread                 //to compile  tas file        
              g++ srcAssgn3-cas-es19btech11003.cpp -o -a -lpthread                 //to compile cas file
              g++ srcAssgn3-cas-bounded-es19btech11003.cpp -o -a -lpthread         // to compile cas-bounded file

To run     :  ./a                                                     //to run
